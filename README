 cJUnit - a JUnit extension for concurrent unit tests


About
=====

Have you ever attempted to write multi-threaded unit tests?  Did you run
them repeatedly in the hope to detect concurrency bugs by chance?  But
you never knew how many times you should repeat such a unit test to make
sure that the unit under test delivers the expected results
independently from the thread interleavings?

cJunit is an extension to the well-known JUnit unit testing framework to
support concurrent unit tests, i.e. to automatically run such tests in
all relevant different thread interleavings.  This way concurrency bugs
in unit tests are detected reliably, not just by chance, and, more
importatly, you can verify that a concurrent unit test produces the
expected results independently from the scheduling of its threads.


Build
=====

To build cJUnit from source you'll need

  - Java 1.6
  - ant 1.7 (or later)

All other software dependencies are included in the cJUnit source tree
under the 'lib/' directory, namely:

  - JUnit: the well-known unit testing framework for Java
  - Java PathFinder (JPF): the model checker used behind the scenes in
    cJUnit
  - JPF's dependencies: BCEL, the Bytecode Engineering Library
  - hamcrest assertion library

You can build cJUnit by running

  ant all

This will create 'cjunit-all.jar', which includes everything needed to run
concurrent unit tests: cJUnit and all its dependencies listed above and
the javadoc of cJUnit's API.  Add this jar to your classpath, and test the
installation by running

  java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore de.fzi.cjunit.AllTests de.fzi.concurrentmatchers.AllTests


Use
===

From an IDE
-----------

Modern Java IDEs like eclipse or NetBeans already contain a JUnit
plugin.  Although these plugins do not provide direct support for
concurrent unit tests, it is still possible to use cJUnit with them.

  - Include 'cjunit-all.jar' in the project's build path.
  - (optional) Set the location of cJUnit's javadoc.
    The javadoc for cJUnit's API for concurrent unit tests is included
    under the 'doc/' directory within the 'cjunit-all.jar' archive.
  - (optional) Filter out cJUnit stack frames from failure stack
    traces with the following filter pattern: 'de.fzi.cjunit.jpf.*'
  - (optional) Specify the source code location, see below.
  - Write concurrent unit tests.
    Test classes containing concurrent unit tests should be annotated
    with @RunWith(ConcurrentRunner.class).
  - Run unit tests using the IDE's JUnit plugin as usual.

From the command line
---------------------

cJUnit can be used from the command line the same way as JUnit.

  - Include 'cjunit-all.jar' in your CLASSPATH.
  - (optional) Specify the source code location, see below.
  - Write concurrent unit tests.
    Test classes containing concurrent unit tests should be annotated
    with @RunWith(ConcurrentRunner.class).
  - Run unit tests as usual:

      java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <tests>

  - (alternativ) Run unit tests with cJUnit the same way as with JUnit:

      java de.fzi.cjunit.ConcurrentJUnit <tests>

    In this case it is not necessary to annotate the test class with
    @RunWith(ConcurrentRunner.class), but then the concurrent unit tests
    could only be run with cJUnit from the command line, and not from an
    IDE plugin.

Specifying source code location
-------------------------------

If a concurrency bug is detected in a concurrent unit test, the execution
path triggering the bug will be printed.  To include the actual source
code in this execution path, the location of source code files has to be
specified.  Note, that specifying the source code location is not
necessary to run concurrent unit tests, but the execution path will be of
much less use when omitted.

To specify the source code locations place a file named 'jpf.properties'
in the directory where cJUnit is invoked from (e.g. the project root) with
the following contents:

  vm.sourcepath=<srcpath1,srcpath2,...>

i.e. 'vm.sourcepath=' followed by a comma separated list of paths
containing the source code files.  For example, if the source files are
under the directories 'src/main' and 'src/test', then the file should
contain the following line:

  vm.sourcepath=src/main,src/test
